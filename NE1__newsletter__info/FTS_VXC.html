    <h2>Page 1 — The Science of Happiness</h2>

    <p class="lede"><strong>What really determines happiness?</strong> Modern research in positive psychology shows that happiness is influenced by three main components. The approximate breakdown commonly cited by researchers is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>~50% Genetic set-point:</strong> Much of our baseline temperament and emotional reactivity is influenced by biology.</li>
      <li><strong>~40% Intenciaj Agadoj (Intentional Activities):</strong> Deliberate practices and habits we choose to do regularly — this is where the largest gains are possible.</li>
      <li><strong>~10% Life circumstances:</strong> Income, living conditions, and other external facts make a smaller contribution than most people expect.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Because nearly half of happiness is shaped by Intentional Activities, small, repeatable practices can raise well-being over time. Examples that research supports include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mindfulness meditation</strong> — improves attention, reduces stress, and increases emotional balance.</li>
      <li><strong>Regular exercise</strong> — releases mood-supporting chemicals and improves sleep and self-esteem.</li>
      <li><strong>Gratitude practices</strong> — noting things you appreciate fosters positive reappraisal.</li>
      <li><strong>Acts of kindness and social connection</strong> — deepen relationships and give purpose.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="quote">
      <em>"Happiness is not a destination — it’s a way of traveling."</em>
    </div>

    <h3>Happiness for students</h3>
    <p>Students face increasing stress and burnout. Learning how happiness works — and adopting small intentional activities — helps build resilience and reduces anxiety. This is a core reason the Fulmo Talk Series focuses on evidence-based well-being resources directed at college and university audiences.</p>
